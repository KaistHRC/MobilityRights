**🥳 2022 KAIST Human Rights Committee May event**

For the event of human rights committee, I designed and developed the mobile web app that offers information of the current status of mobility facilities for impaired people in KAIST Campus. 

The design aimed to be intuitive to get the information of the building, and lead users to be interested in mobility rights.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- *React Router, Google Sheet API v3*

## 💬 How it works
Google Sheets file that only committee members can access is linked as the database, so the maintenance and update is simple.

Posters similar as above have been distributed each building in KAIST Campus. If the user scan the QR code, they can directly access in the building page (3rd screen capture in heroshot) and **get the information of building accessibility for impaired person.**

If there is no data collected for that building, the page offers google form link for report. This is participatory project with KAIST students, so it is designed to encourage participation.
